# WWP-D3
The purpose of this repository is to explore data visualizations for the Women Writers' Project. Currently I am exploring using D3.js to create scatterplot visualizations based on Principal Component Analysis.

## Usage
To run the code, simply start up a live server in the root directory.

## Github Pages
A public version of the visualization can be found here: <a href="https://neu-dsg.github.io/wwp-d3" target="_blank">https://neu-dsg.github.io/wwp-d3</a>
